## Sync Async Concurrent Demo
### The purpose of this application section is to demonstrate the difference between Sync, Async, and Concurrent server calls with thread synchronization

It includes:

> Ajax calls to a controller, whose model simulates server calls, using Task.Delay().Wait();

> Ajax calls to another controller, whose model calls an API, which in turn simulates third-party server calls, using Task.Delay().Wait();
